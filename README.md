## General Information

Get all provinces in Kenya, find constituencies by county etc. This project was born out of my frustration finding an api containing such data.

I made a form that required users to select a county, constituency and ward and I did not find a good resource to use, thus making my own.

## Technologies Used

- Express
- Mongodb
